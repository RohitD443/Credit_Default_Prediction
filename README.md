📊 Loan Default Prediction System
📌 Overview

This project predicts loan default risk using machine learning models on credit scoring data.
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation techniques commonly used in financial risk analytics.

The system applies multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance, helping financial institutions assess the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess real-world loan applicant data

Handle missing values effectively (imputation & removal strategies)

Perform feature encoding and scaling

Train classification models to predict loan defaults

Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix
