💳 Credit Default Prediction
📌 Overview

This project predicts credit default risk using machine learning models on financial and demographic data.
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation, making it a practical end-to-end ML project for financial risk analytics.

The system applies multiple classification algorithms and compares their performance, helping banks and financial institutions assess the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess real-world credit scoring data

Handle missing values (median/mode imputation & column drop)
